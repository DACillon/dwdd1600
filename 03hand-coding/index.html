        <p>Skateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called "sidewalk surfing" â€“ a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular.</p>
            <p>By the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as <em>Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha</em> started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California.</p>

            <h2>How it first started</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom.</li>
                    <li>No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>What do they look like now?</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of boards that have come out today ranging from small penny boards to longboards. Most decks are are made of Canadian Maple. The reason most decks are made with this type of wood is becuase it is to flexible to withstand the shock of hard landings and makes it lightweight. The most popular skate brand around today is <strong>Santa Cruz Skateboards</strong>. </p>
