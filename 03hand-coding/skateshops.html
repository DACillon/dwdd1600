            <h1>Skate Shops</h1>
            <p>What is a skate shop you might ask. A skate shop is a place where you can buy clothing, shoes, or skate parts. Some skate parts that you can buy for example are decks, grip tape, bearings, hardware, trucks, and wheels. Instead of buying parts to build a skateboard, most skate shops sell fully built skateboards. One of the most famouse skateshops around is called Santa Cruz Skate shop. Santa Cruz Skateboards, located in Santa Cruz California, was established in 1973 by then owners, Richard Novak, Doug Haut and Jay Shuirman who founded NHS Inc. Santa Cruz Skateboards has long been revered as one of the original skateboard companies that has not only survived over the years but contributed to the innovation and modernization of skateboards and skateboarding. In 2013 NHS celebrated its 40th anniversary. </p>
